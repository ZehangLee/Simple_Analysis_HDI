# Functionality Explaination

### Data 

This data set is from the UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME which published from 1990 to now, which covers 189 countries.

The data we used are focused on Demography and the Health Status.

* Data Tyding in General

We first define the regions then group the data by regions and by the development level. According to the Human Development rankings, we divided the dataset into 4 levels. The cutoff points are HDI of less than 0.550 for low human development, 0.550–0.699 for medium human development, 0.700–0.799 for high human develop- ment and 0.800 or greater for very high human development.

* Data Reporting

According to the years people choose in the app, the app caltulated the mean of the variables with respect to the period, then shows the relevant graphs.

* Missing Data

Two ways of dealing with missing data.

When calculating the mean of each group, there are some missing data. For those with missing values for just one year or two, the idea is to delete the missing year.

For the NA value after calculating the group mean, the idea is to fill the NAs with 0.

### App Functionality Description

This App is aiming to give a brief view of the demography and the health status in different countries. It is also possible to do the comparison between different regions and different development level.

For the Demography part, it is possible to see the whole population, the urban population rate, then young age (0 to 14) rate, and the old age (65 and older) rate. And according to the bar plot at the end of the page, it can be seen large differences among different countries.

For the Health Status part, it is possible to see a brief introduction to different health status by the radar graph. Then the bar chart elaborate the adult HIV prevalence from age 15 to 49, then the current health expenditure of GDP for each selected countries (regions or development levels.). Then the line chart explained how the life expectancy goes along time. The last bar chart represented the mortality rate for each age level.
